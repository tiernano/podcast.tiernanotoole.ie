In todays episode, i talk about how i record the podcast. in particular i talk about the software, hardware and tools i use to record.

  * I record the podcast using [iTalk by Griffin][1].
  * I use [Dropbox][2] to send files from my iPhone to my main machine.
  * I use the [Lame MP3 encoder][3] to encode the AIFF file from iTalk into an MP3 that you listen to&#8230;
  * I use [CyberDuck ][4]to upload the files to [RackSpace Cloud][5], who use [Akamai ][6]as their CDN provider&#8230;
  * Finally, i use a self hosted install of [WordPress ][7]to run the site, and i post a couple days or weeks in advance before the podcast actually arrives by either [iTunes][8] or [Zune][9], or what ever you are using to listen to this show.
