In an article i wrote on [my other blog][1] entitled &#8220;[5+ Screens and a Cloud][2]&#8221; i wrote about the idea of having more than just the standard 3 screens Microsoft talk about in their &#8220;3 Screens and a Cloud&#8221; idea. In this podcast, i talk about this idea more, and try flesh out some of the ideas a bit better, explaining what i think about them.
